        <p id="two"> First of all , I want to thank you mr. Tom Butler for giving a impeccable teaching.
            From this module , I learn a lot of things from the area of computers. The first thing that I observed is the high level of attention and concentration yourself to clearely understand the given information. Next , I want to say that this course gave me a different type of thinking regarding to school. This course learned me that I don't need to be sad or upset because I can't finish a exercise . This course learned me that I need to revision and read again everything with high carefully and  every code problem will be resolved . A significant part of the modeule are the self study sessions . Here , you learn how to use your visual memory , improve communicationskills because every time , during the classes , we talk to each other and get solutions for problems together. The targets that I want to touch them , is to practice all the summer for web developing module bacause I want to make a pathway from this area . I like how simply is the logic from the back of the programs , I want to develope my skills in JavScript because is a very usefull language and can provide a very satisfied career.
        </p>
        <p id="three">I was having a lot of downs at the begining because comming from a different highschool course , it was hard for me to understand how some things works. For example when I observe that in the Html are so many numbers and characters , I was so confused . In my mind was like a big boom when I saw how you can creeate functions , how you can design and how you can make a debugging process. The moment when I realise how many things you can do with a computer was special for me . When I realise that I can make a red ball that is moving on the screen I was so excited . When I change the color of the ball in CSS I felt like a artist . After this points I started to practice more and more till I get some good knowledge in html and css . </p>
        <p id="four">About the design part from css , I was really excited to practice more . My favorite colors are green and purple and regarding of this , I combine my tastes with the css . In a significant part of my self practice in css I have used green and purple. Moreover , I feel like a painter when I open the css . Right now , Web Development is my favourite module and this is just because of Tom . He have good skills in communication with the students and he answer me every time I asked him a question. I think the most significant part for a student who learn to write code is the routine . Understanding the logic is not easy but with a good routine that keep you productive and on top , every person can understand , at some points , the way how the things are going in this module . I wait for the next year , to develope more skills in Web Developing , learn new things and enjoy every single class that I will do .  </p>
        <p id="five">I can't wait the next sessions at the Web Developing module . I want to learn more things about the web pages and how I can design them . I want to make more practice and have better skills for developing good solutions for the problems.</p>
